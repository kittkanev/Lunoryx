{"Rendering / performance",R"DOC(Settings > Render preset: Office uses direct colour and reduced 3D resolution; Balanced adds FXAA; Quality adds FXAA, LDR colour grading and directional PCF shadows. F8 cycles presets in editor and game. UI stays at window resolution. Effects are optional and cost GPU time. Initial settings keep full resolution with effects off.
Cached mesh renderer batches by material, uses VBOs where supported and conservatively culls meshes outside the camera. Unsupported buffers use client arrays. Shader/shadow failures fall back to direct rendering. Quality shadows cover a bounded 25-unit region with a fixed sun, not HDR/full PBR.
Sculpt has Inflate/Deflate, Smooth, Flatten, X symmetry, brush-radius feedback and updated smooth normals. Bake node results/apply modifiers first. Shift reverses Inflate.)DOC"},
{"Getting started",R"DOC(LUNORYX STUDIO
Scene tab: orbit with RMB, pan with MMB, zoom with the wheel.
Q/W/E/R: Select/Move/Rotate/Scale. Drag gizmo axes or planes to transform objects.
Local and Snap are in the Scene toolbar; Edit offers scene undo/redo (Ctrl+Z/Y).
Settings stores camera, grid, snap, theme, VSync and master volume.
Audio imports WAV/MP3/FLAC/OGG/W64/RF64; files can be dragged onto the window.
Click to select. Ctrl+click selects multiple objects. Explorer shows objects and scripts.
Tools > Build: spawn primitives, snap to grid, duplicate, join selected meshes.
Tools > Sculpt: subdivide, choose a brush, then hold LMB on the selected mesh.
Tools > Character: set proportions and colors, then Create Character.
Play Simulation: gravity, AABB collisions, WASD movement and Space to jump.
Stop restores the scene captured at Play. Lua animation has its own Pause button.
Scripts: create tabs with + Script. F5 runs the active script. F11 expands the editor.
Output is inside the app; the Windows executable opens no console window.

Stop Play Simulation before saving. File > Save Project / Load Project uses .lunoryx files for geometry, properties,
scripts and environment. Loaded scripts do not run automatically. Run them explicitly.
GLB is a separate geometry/material export and does not contain editor metadata.

Types: cube, pyramid, sphere, cylinder, plane.
get_rotation / get_scale / get_color / get_material read values.
get_object_count(), clear_scene(), get_time() are also available.
Transform and material setters validate ALL numbers before changing the object.
NaN, infinity and values outside float range cause a Lua error.

Physics runs when Play Simulation is enabled in the toolbar.
Static objects have Dynamic disabled; they still collide with dynamic bodies.
Character movement: WASD, Space jump, while the Scene tab is active.
Stop restores the scene, including properties and mesh geometry.
Collision shapes are world-axis-aligned boxes, not triangle meshes.
Character builder creates an editable colored mesh, not a skinned animation rig.
Mass: 0.01..10000. Restitution: 0..1. Velocity components: -10000..10000.

function on_update(dt)
    -- Lua animation callback; seconds, clamped by the editor frame loop.

Running a new script clears the previous on_update. Other Lua globals persist within that Lua state; each new Play creates a fresh state.
Errors pause Lua. Calls have a 1,000,000-instruction budget.
Scripts are TRUSTED: standard libraries can access files and processes.

Join is mesh concatenation, not a boolean solid union.
Vertex colors are preserved; the first source supplies metallic/roughness.
Sources' scripts and custom properties are not merged.
Sculpt subdivision limit: 4 passes per operation; 200,000 vertices per mesh.
The selected brush operates in LOCAL coordinates and exports to GLB.

Properties are typed: number, boolean or text. Edit them in Properties.
Names: 1..64 bytes. Text values: at most 1024 bytes. Numbers must be finite floats.
Missing properties return no value. Invalid indices return false / no value.
Properties are copied when duplicating an object.

Export includes visible primitives, sculpted/joined meshes, vertex colors,
transforms in degrees converted to quaternions, normals, UV, textures and PBR material factors.
It excludes Lua code, callbacks, custom properties, physics and the skybox.
The viewport has simple directional shading; it is not a full PBR renderer.

Audio window: volume, pitch, loop, autoplay, spatial position, preview/stop.

MCP: start Lunoryx.exe --mcp from your MCP client (stdio transport).
The process uses this original engine with a separate headless scene.
Tools: scene_list, add_object, set_transform, remove_object, project_save,
project_load, export_glb, run_lua, add_sound, undo_objects, redo_objects, mesh_operation.
Use stable object IDs returned by MCP; legacy Lua continues to use array indices.

run_lua executes TRUSTED Lua with standard libraries, as in the original editor.

New third-person example creates Gem Trail. Save the editable project, use Play to test, then Build standalone Game.exe. All imported scene resources are embedded; no compiler is required. Stop restores the editor scene and a fresh Play creates a new Lua state.

Lua: input_key('W') returns a key state; follow_camera(index, distance, pitch) follows an object; game_score(value) sets a nonnegative score and game_score() reads it; hud_text(text) replaces the HUD message; restart_game() schedules a fresh run. WASD / Space control a Character. Use only trusted scripts.

MCP --mcp retains stable object IDs. Lua object indices remain zero-based and shift after removal. mesh_operation(index, action, options_json) supports modifier/apply/boolean/polygonize/extrude/weld/delete/normals/unwrap. Invalid operations leave the original mesh intact.

Modeling limits: Bevel needs a closed oriented mesh; apply modifiers before sculpt or UV editing. GLB import is static and reports unsupported features. Viewport lighting is a simple compatibility-OpenGL preview; physics uses AABBs.)DOC"}
